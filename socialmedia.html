    <!-- SECTION 1 — EARLY INTERNET MEMES -->
    <section class="content-section">
      <h2><span aria-hidden="true">🧠</span> 1. Early Internet Memes (1996–Present)</h2>
      <h3>The Dancing Baby (1996) — widely considered the first viral internet meme, blending surreal animation with early digital humor.</h3>

      </div>
      
      <p>
        Internet memes began as quirky digital artifacts—simple, shareable, and often surreal. The term “meme” was coined by evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in 1976 to describe cultural units that replicate like genes. Online, this concept evolved into visual jokes, looping animations, and image macros that spread rapidly across forums and email chains.
        The first meme to go viral was the <strong>Dancing Baby</strong> in 1996. Created using Autodesk’s 3D animation software, it featured a baby grooving to “Hooked on a Feeling.” It spread via email and Usenet, later appearing on TV shows like <em>Ally McBeal</em>. This surreal clip marked the birth of internet humor as a global phenomenon.

       <h3>Iconic Meme Compilation — a visual archive of internet memes that shaped online identity, humor, and participatory culture.</h3>

        </div>
        <p>
          As internet culture matured, memes became more structured and recognizable. Image macros like LOLcats (“I Can Has Cheezburger?”), Rage Comics, and Advice Animals dominated platforms like 4chan, Reddit, and early Facebook. These formats were easy to remix and share, making them ideal for participatory humor.
          Scholars like Limor Shifman and Jean Burgess have studied memes as tools of identity, commentary, and community. Memes are no longer just jokes—they’re cultural currency, shaping how we communicate, protest, and play online.

      <h3>Meme Trends in 2025 — showcasing how short-form video memes reflect algorithmic virality, absurdist humor, and global digital communities.</h3>

      </div>
      <p>
        Today, meme culture is faster, more visual, and algorithm-driven. TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts have turned memes into short-form video trends. In 2025, memes are often born from viral audio clips, stitched reactions, and absurdist humor that spreads globally in hours.
        Trends now emerge from niche subcultures and rapidly scale through algorithmic amplification. Memes are increasingly used for political commentary, brand marketing, and even mental health awareness—blurring the line between entertainment and activism.

    <!-- SECTION 2 — VIRAL VIDEO ERA -->
    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>📹 2. Viral Video Era (2005–2013)</h2>

      <h3>“Charlie Bit My Finger” (2007) — a candid family moment that became one of YouTube’s earliest viral hits.</h3>
      <div class="video-container">
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0EqSXDwTq6U" title="Charlie Bit My Finger" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      </div>
      <p>
          The launch of <strong>YouTube in 2005</strong> marked a turning point in internet culture. For the first time, users could easily upload, share, and discover videos globally. This democratization of media gave rise to viral clips that blended authenticity, humor, and absurdity—often created by everyday people rather than professionals.
          One of the earliest and most iconic examples was <strong>“Charlie Bit My Finger”</strong>, a home video featuring two young brothers. Its unscripted charm and relatable sibling dynamic resonated with millions, earning over 900 million views and inspiring countless remixes, parodies, and references across pop culture.
      </p>

      <h3>Keyboard Cat and Remix Culture — early viral videos that evolved into meme formats through creative re-editing.</h3>
      <div class="video-container">
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J---aiyznGQ" title="Keyboard Cat Original" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      </div>
      <p>
        Other viral sensations like <strong>Keyboard Cat</strong>, <strong>Dramatic Chipmunk</strong>, and <strong>Star Wars Kid</strong> became foundational to remix culture. These clips were frequently repurposed with new soundtracks, edits, and contexts—transforming them into meme-like formats that circulated widely across blogs, forums, and early social media.
        This era showed how video could function like image-based memes: modular, remixable, and socially expressive. The humor often relied on timing, repetition, and absurd juxtapositions—hallmarks of early internet comedy.
      </p>

      <h3>YouTube as Cultural Archive — how amateur content reshaped media norms and legitimized participatory creativity.</h3>
      <div class="video-container">
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M9sSNpjQYYI" title="Top Viral Videos Before YouTube" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      </div>
        <p>
            Scholars <strong>Jean Burgess</strong> and <strong>Joshua Green</strong> described YouTube as a <em>“cultural archive”</em>, where amateur content gained visibility and legitimacy. Viral videos from this period challenged traditional media hierarchies, proving that user-generated content could be just as influential and entertaining as professionally produced material.
            The viral video era laid the groundwork for today’s creator economy, where humor, identity, and storytelling are shaped by everyday users. It also established the visual grammar of internet comedy—quick cuts, reaction shots, and remixable formats—that continue to influence meme culture today.

    <!-- SECTION 3 — SHORT-FORM PLATFORMS -->
    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>🍃 3. Short-Form Platforms (2013–2016)</h2>
      <h3>Vine’s 6-Second Revolution — how brevity sparked a new era of visual comedy and viral creativity.</h3>
      <div class="video-container">
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rfd9cnA-QJc" title="King Bach Vine Compilation" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      </div>
      <div class="video-container">
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GQrV88bAfJ8" title="Brittany Furlan Vine Compilation"
          allowfullscreen></iframe>
      </div>
      <p>
        The launch of <strong>Vine</strong> in 2013 introduced a radical constraint: six-second looping videos. This limitation became a creative catalyst, giving rise to a new genre of punchy, absurdist humor. Vine’s format encouraged rapid-fire storytelling, visual gags, and comedic timing that relied on surprise and repetition.
        Creators like <strong>King Bach</strong>, <strong>Brittany Furlan</strong>, and <strong>Jerome Jarre</strong> became breakout stars, pioneering sketch formats and character-driven comedy that defined the platform’s style. Their content was fast, funny, and deeply shareable—perfect for the mobile-first generation.
      </p>

      <h3>From Vine to TikTok — how short-form video reshaped digital attention and participatory humor.</h3>
      <div class="video-container">
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3lGMyLR5E2A" title="From Vine to TikTok" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      </div>
        <p>
          Vine’s influence extended far beyond its lifespan. Its looping format and emphasis on brevity laid the groundwork for platforms like <strong>TikTok</strong> and <strong>Instagram Reels</strong>. These successors adopted Vine’s core principles—short duration, remixability, and algorithmic discovery—while expanding the toolkit for creators.
          Snapchat and Instagram Stories added ephemeral, reaction-based content, making comedy more personal and immediate. The rise of “micro-comedy” reflected shifting attention spans and mobile-first consumption habits, as noted in digital media studies.
          Though Vine shut down in 2017, its legacy lives on in the structure, pacing, and participatory nature of today’s short-form video culture. It helped normalize the idea that anyone with a phone could be a creator—and that six seconds could be enough to make a cultural impact.

    <!-- SECTION 4 — SOCIAL MEDIA COMEDY -->
    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>📱 4. Social Media Comedy (2016–Present)</h2>
      <h3>Collaborative Comedy — how TikTok, Reels, and Shorts turned humor into a remixable, algorithm-driven performance.</h3>
      <div class="video-container">

      </div>
        <p>
          Platforms like <strong>TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts</strong> have transformed comedy into a participatory experience. Features like duets, stitches, and filters allow users to build on each other’s jokes, creating viral chains of humor that evolve in real time.
          Comedy trends are now shaped by audio clips, visual formats, and challenges that spread rapidly through algorithmic amplification. These short-form videos reflect a shift toward mobile-first, attention-grabbing humor that thrives on remixability and global reach.
        </p>

      <h3>Networked Performance — how audiences co-create meaning and humor through digital interaction.</h3>
      <div class="video-container">
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZyQaVHOu_Wk" title="Best TikToks Summer 2025" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      </div>
        <p>
          Scholars describe this as <strong>“networked performance”</strong>—a mode of digital expression where audiences actively participate in shaping comedic content. Humor becomes a shared language, shaped by platform design and community engagement.
          In 2025, TikTok comedy is increasingly driven by niche communities, AI-generated effects, and collaborative storytelling formats. Users remix each other’s content, respond with stitched reactions, and build layered narratives that reflect both personal identity and collective creativity.
