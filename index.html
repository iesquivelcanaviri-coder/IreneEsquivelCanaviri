                      <p>
                        Irish comedy has ancient roots in bardic satire and storytelling. In medieval Gaelic society, poets known as "filí" used satire to mock kings and nobles, often wielding humor as a form of social control. These oral traditions laid the foundation for Ireland’s enduring wit and narrative style.

                      <strong>🎭 Ancient Laughs:</strong> Around 425 BCE, Aristophanes, often called the “Father of Comedy,” wrote plays that satirized Athenian society. His works like <em>The Clouds</em> mocked philosophers such as Socrates, while <em>Lysistrata</em> used humor to protest war. These plays were performed during public festivals like the Dionysia, blending entertainment with civic critique — a tradition that shaped political satire for centuries.

                      <strong>📜 Shakespeare’s Twist:</strong> In the late 16th and early 17th centuries, William Shakespeare redefined comedy in the English Renaissance. Unlike modern stand-up, “comedy” then referred to plays with happy endings, often involving marriage and reconciliation. Works like <em>Twelfth Night</em> and <em>Much Ado About Nothing</em> used clever wordplay, disguise, and romantic confusion — laying the foundation for today’s romantic comedies.

                      <strong>🎭 Masked Mayhem:</strong> Commedia dell’Arte emerged in Italy during the 1500s as a form of street theater. It featured masked characters like Harlequin and Pantalone, each representing social archetypes. Performers improvised dialogue and physical comedy based on loose scenarios, influencing European theater and later comedic forms like pantomime, sketch comedy, and sitcoms.

                      <strong>🎤 Vaudeville Roots:</strong> Vaudeville dominated American entertainment from the 1880s to the 1930s. It was a live variety format that included comedy, music, dance, and novelty acts. Stars like Buster Keaton and the Marx Brothers began here, and its structure — short, punchy segments — directly influenced the pacing and style of modern television comedy.

                      <strong>🎬 Silent Legends:</strong> In the early 20th century, silent film comedians like Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton mastered visual storytelling. Without dialogue, they relied on exaggerated gestures, slapstick routines, and expressive facial acting. Their films, such as <em>The Kid</em> and <em>The General</em>, proved that humor could transcend language and culture — a principle still true in visual comedy today.

                      <strong>📺 TV Revolution:</strong> Premiering in 1951, <em>I Love Lucy</em> transformed television comedy. It introduced the three-camera setup, live studio audience, and laugh track — techniques still used in sitcoms today. Lucille Ball’s physical humor and timing set a new standard for female comedians, and the show’s success helped establish comedy as a central genre in American TV.

This shift from stage to screen to scroll has redefined comedic timing, audience interaction, and the role of humor in everyday life — making digital comedy a global phenomenon.
